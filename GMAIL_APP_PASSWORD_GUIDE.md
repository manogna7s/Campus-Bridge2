   - Go to https://myaccount.google.com/

2. **Navigate to Security Settings**
   - Click on "Security" in the left navigation panel

3. **Enable 2-Step Verification (if not already enabled)**
   - Scroll down to "2-Step Verification" and click on it
   - Follow the prompts to set up 2FA if it's not already enabled

   - Scroll down to "App passwords" (under "2-Step Verification")
   - Click on "App passwords"

5. **Select App and Device**

   - Under "Select device," choose "Other (Custom name)"
   - Enter "Campus Bridge" as the custom name
   - Click "Generate"

6. **Copy and Use the Password**
   - You'll see a 16-character password displayed
   - Copy this password (without spaces)
   - Use it in your [.env](file:///Users/madanthambisetty/Downloads/Campus-Bridge/.env) file

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: "Mail" option not available
- Make sure 2-Step Verification is enabled first
- Try refreshing the page
- Try using a different browser

### Issue: "Other" device option not available
- This should always be available
- Make sure you're not selecting a pre-defined device option

### Issue: App password not working
- Make sure you're copying all 16 characters
- Ensure there are no spaces in the password
- Double-check that you're using the App Password, not your regular password

## Example Configuration

Once you have your App Password, update your [.env](file:///Users/madanthambisetty/Downloads/Campus-Bridge/.env) file like this:

```env
# Email Configuration
# For Gmail, you need to generate an App Password: https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
EMAIL_SERVICE=Gmail
EMAIL_USER=manognasamayam@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=abcdefghijklmnop  # Your 16-character App Password (no spaces)
EMAIL_FROM=manognasamayam@gmail.com
```

## Testing Your Configuration

After updating your [.env](file:///Users/madanthambisetty/Downloads/Campus-Bridge/.env) file:

1. Restart your server
2. Register a new user account
3. Check the email address for a verification message
4. Click the verification link to activate the account

```

### Yahoo
```env
EMAIL_SERVICE=yahoo
