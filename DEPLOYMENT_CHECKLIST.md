- [ ] Click "Shell" tab
- [ ] Run: `npm run init-render-db`
- [ ] Check output for success messages

## Phase 4: Testing

### [ ] Test Application
- [ ] Visit your Render URL
- [ ] Register a new user
- [ ] Check email for verification link
- [ ] Verify email and log in
- [ ] Test PDF upload functionality

### [ ] Verify Database Connection
- [ ] Go to `/db-status.html` on your Render site
- [ ] Confirm database is connected
- [ ] Check `/api/db/users/count` endpoint
- [ ] Check `/api/db/tables` endpoint

## Phase 5: Monitoring

### [ ] Set Up Monitoring (Optional)
- [ ] Configure uptime monitoring
- [ ] Set up error tracking
- [ ] Configure alerts for critical issues

## Troubleshooting Quick Reference

If you encounter issues:

1. **Bad Gateway Error**:
   - Check all environment variables
   - Verify MySQL credentials
   - Run database initialization

2. **Database Connection Failed**:
   - Double-check MySQL connection details
   - Ensure password is correct
   - For FreeSQLDatabase.com, ensure MYSQL_SSL=false is set

3. **Email Not Working**:
   - Confirm Gmail App Password is correct
   - Check EMAIL_SERVICE is set to "Gmail"
   - Verify EMAIL_FROM matches EMAIL_USER

4. **Application Not Starting**:
   - Check Render logs for error messages
   - Verify all required environment variables are set
   - Ensure start command is correct

## Useful Commands

In Render Shell:
- Test database status: `curl http://localhost:3000/api/db/status`
- Initialize database: `npm run init-render-db`
- Check users count: `curl http://localhost:3000/api/db/users/count`
- List tables: `curl http://localhost:3000/api/db/tables`
